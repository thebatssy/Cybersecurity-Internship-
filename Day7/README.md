# Day 7 - Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions  


### ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
Learn how to spot and remove potentially harmful browser extensions.  

### ðŸ›  Tools  
- Web Browser: Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based, similar to Chrome/Firefox)  
- Chrome Web Store for reviews/ratings  

### ðŸ“‹ Steps Taken  
1. Opened browserâ€™s extension/add-ons manager.  
2. Reviewed all installed extensions.  
3. Checked their ratings, reviews, and requested permissions.  
4. Researched whether they are considered safe or suspicious.  
5. Identified unnecessary/suspicious ones.  

### ðŸ”Ž Extensions Reviewed  
- **Tampermonkey**  
- **WebCRX**  
- **Stands AdBlocker**  

Detailed findings are available in [`report.txt`](report.txt).  

### ðŸ“Œ Key Learnings  
- High ratings alone do **not** guarantee safety.  
- Always check requested **permissions** and **data access scope**.  
- Prefer open-source or community-trusted extensions (e.g., uBlock Origin instead of lesser-known ad blockers).  
- Keep only essential extensions to reduce the attack surface.  

### âœ… Outcome  
Awareness of browser extension risks, ability to identify suspicious extensions, and practice in documenting & analyzing them.
