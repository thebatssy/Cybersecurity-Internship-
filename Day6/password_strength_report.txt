💡 Observations:
- Passwords with dictionary words or number-only suffixes are very weak.
- Adding symbols and using upper/lower case increases strength.
- Longer passwords (12+ chars) perform much better.
- Passphrases (e.g. “I<3CoffeeIn2025!”) are also secure and memorable.

✅ Best Practices Learned:
- Use at least 12–16 characters.
- Mix character types: Aa-Zz, 0-9, and symbols (!@#).
- Avoid personal info or real words.
- Use a password manager to avoid reuse.
- Enable 2FA/MFA wherever possible.

📌 Conclusion:
Strong passwords are the first defense against brute force and dictionary attacks. Complexity and length significantly improve your password security posture.
