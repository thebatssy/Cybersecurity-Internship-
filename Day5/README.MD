# Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## Objective:
Captured live network packets and identified 3 basic protocols: HTTP, DNS, TCP.

## Tools Used:
- Wireshark

## Steps Followed:
- Installed and launched Wireshark.
- Selected active Wi-Fi interface.
- Browsed to "https://www.wikipedia.org" to generate network traffic.
- Stopped capture after 1 minute.
- Applied filters: http, dns, tcp.
- Identified 3 protocols from the captured traffic.
- Exported capture as .pcap file.
- Created a short analysis report.

## Protocols Identified:
- **HTTP**: Used when browsing the Wikipedia site.
- **DNS**: Used to resolve the domain name to an IP address.
- **TCP**: Transport layer protocol carrying HTTP and DNS packets.

## Outcome:
Learned to monitor live traffic using Wireshark and analyze protocols in real time.

## Files Submitted:
- sample_capture.pcap  
- capture_report.txt
