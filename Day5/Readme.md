Objective:
Captured live network packets and identified 3 basic protocols: HTTP, DNS, TCP.

Tools Used:
- Wireshark

Steps Followed:
1. Installed and launched Wireshark.
2. Selected active Wi-Fi interface.
3. Browsed to "https://www.wikipedia.org" to generate network traffic.
4. Stopped capture after 1 minute.
5. Applied filters: http, dns, tcp.
6. Identified 3 protocols from the captured traffic.
7. Exported capture as .pcap file.
8. Created a short analysis report.

Protocols Identified:
- HTTP: Used when browsing the Wikipedia site.
- DNS: Used to resolve the domain name to an IP address.
- TCP: Transport layer protocol carrying HTTP and DNS packets.

Outcome:
Learned to monitor live traffic using Wireshark and analyze protocols in real time.
