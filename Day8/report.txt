Steps Performed:
1. Baseline check of my internet connection:
   - Public IP address (via whatismyipaddress.com) was shown as my ISP-assigned IP in India.
   - Speed test showed ~170 Mbps download.
   
2. Installed and configured ProtonVPN:
   - Signed up for ProtonVPN free account.
   - Installed ProtonVPN client and logged in.
   - Connected to a free US server.

3. Verification of VPN connection:
   - Public IP changed from India → US (ProtonVPN server location).
   - Browsing showed a new geolocation based on VPN IP.

4. Speed comparison:
   - After connecting to VPN, speed reduced to ~3.6 Mbps due to server load.
   - Latency increased compared to baseline connection.

5. Encrypted traffic verification:
   - Opened a HTTPS website in Microsoft Edge.
   - Checked padlock icon → “Connection is secure”.
   - Verified in DevTools Security panel → TLS 1.3 encryption active.

Observations:
- VPN successfully masked my real IP address.
- VPN connection encrypted my internet traffic.
- Speed dropped significantly on the free server, highlighting limitations of free VPN services.
- HTTPS + VPN provided a strong privacy combination.

Conclusion:
VPNs are valuable tools for protecting online privacy, especially on public Wi-Fi networks. They mask IP addresses, secure data with encryption, and provide anonymity. However, free VPNs often come with speed limitations, fewer server options, and possible reliability issues. For better performance, a trusted paid VPN service is recommended.
