# ðŸ”’ Task 8: Working with VPNs  

## ðŸ“Œ Objective  
Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and secure communication.  

## ðŸ›  Tools Used  
- ProtonVPN (Free Tier)  
- WhatIsMyIP / IP Location  
- Fast.com (Speed Test)  
- Microsoft Edge Security Panel  

## ðŸ“Š Steps Performed  
1. Checked baseline public IP and speed test.  
2. Installed and connected ProtonVPN (US Free Server).  
3. Verified VPN-assigned IP address vs. original ISP IP.  
4. Compared speed tests before and after VPN connection.  
5. Confirmed encrypted HTTPS traffic (TLS 1.3) using Edge DevTools.  

## âœ… Key Learnings  
- VPN hides real IP and replaces it with VPN server IP.  
- HTTPS/TLS ensures encrypted communication.  
- Free VPN servers may affect speed due to server load.  
- VPN is useful on public Wi-Fi, but not a replacement for HTTPS.
